# BomberMan Minecraft Minigame

⚠️ **This plugin was not developed with the intention of being plug-and-play for every server. It was intentionally only designed for one particular server.**

Dive into the explosive world of BomberMan, a Minecraft minigame that pays homage to the classic BomberMan game. Experience an exhilarating blend of strategy and excitement as players are teleported into a custom-built map, where their primary objective is to blast their way through obstacles and opponents alike.

- Each match is a new adventure, thanks to an array of bomb types that ensure no two games are the same.
- Only one can emerge victorious in this intense last-man-standing showdown.
- Adding to the thrill, a world border steadily closes in towards the map's center, ramping up the challenge and pushing players closer to confrontation.
